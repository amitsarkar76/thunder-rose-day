         I donâ€™t know when it happened, but somewhere along the way, you became my everything. Your smile lights up my world, and your presence makes every moment more beautiful. I canâ€™t imagine a future without you in it. You are not just the reason my heart beats faster; youâ€™re the reason it beats at all. I want to be by your side, through every joy, every challenge, and every dream. Will you let me call you mine and share this amazing journey of life together Here's to many more petals of shared laughter and enduring love.
